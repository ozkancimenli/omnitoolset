## 📊 Current Status

- **Pages with ads:** All pages now have ads ✅
- **High priority Turkish translations:** 100% complete ✅
- **Medium priority Turkish translations:** 100% complete ✅
- **Placeholder tools fixed:** 1/69 (area-calculator)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Continue fixing placeholder tools - remove "coming soon" alerts from working tools
2. Implement truly placeholder tools (those with no functionality)
3. Translate remaining low-priority Turkish content (33 files with 1 word each)

## 📝 Notes

- Many tools marked as "placeholder" actually have working functionality
- Need to verify each tool individually
- Focus on tools that truly have no functionality

I've been building OmniToolset for the past year - a collection of 270+ free online tools that work entirely in your browser.

What makes it different:
✅ No signup required
✅ No watermarks
✅ Your files never leave your device (100% client-side)
✅ 270+ tools covering PDF, images, text, developer needs
✅ 130+ blog guides

Categories:
• PDF: Merge, split, compress, convert, rotate
• Image: Resize, compress, format conversion
• Text: Case converter, word counter, text diff
• Developer: JSON formatter, base64, regex tester
• Media: Video/audio converters
• Calculators: BMI, mortgage, loan calculators

I built this because I was tired of tool sites that require signups for simple tasks or add watermarks. Everything here is completely free and private.

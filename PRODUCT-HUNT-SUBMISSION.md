Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share OmniToolset with you today. This has been a passion project of mine - building a comprehensive collection of free online tools that actually respect your privacy.

🔑 What makes OmniToolset different:
• Everything runs in your browser - no server uploads
• 270+ tools covering PDF, images, text, developer needs
• 130+ blog guides to help you use each tool
• Completely free, no premium tiers, no paywalls

I built this because I was frustrated with tool sites that:
- Require signups for simple tasks
- Add watermarks to free results
- Upload your files to their servers
- Show too many ads

OmniToolset solves all of these problems. Your files stay on your device, results are clean, and the site is fast and ad-free in the right places.

I'd love your feedback! What tools would you like to see added? What features are missing?

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀
